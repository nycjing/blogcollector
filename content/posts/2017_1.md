New Year's first run and the Israeli half marathon race in the desert
 
Today is New Year's Day. The first run of the new year is to run five miles with my Israeli friend Ehud. I have known him for 10 years. It was with his encouragement that I started triathelon trainings three years ago. While running, he told me one of his best running story. One of my new year plans is to record an interesting story every week. I will start with his story.

Ehud returned to Israel on a business trip in mid-December. After working on Friday, he drove for 2 hours to a camp ground on the edge of the desert. He joined a desert challenge organized by locals. (He and his brother's group of friends went together) First, he pitched the tent. He rode a bicycle for two hours early on Saturday morning. Go back to sleep in the tent. In the middle of the night, he carried a night light on his head to run the desert half marathon. His running score is one hour and fifty minutes. After returning to rest in the tent, he went to ride a bicycle for two hours on Sunday. In the afternoon, he drove back to Tel Aviv to fly back to New York. Itâ€™s Sunday in New York. Then he took his wife and children to the museum.

Note: I enjoy others' fun stories. I wrote a note and record it later to share with friends.
